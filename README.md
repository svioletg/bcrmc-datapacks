# bcrmc packs and stuff

Datapacks and resource packs for our servers.

BCRMC6's custom jukebox song OGGs are hosted on the server I'm using to make the ZIP links and not in this repository, 'cause, y'know, copyright. Only exclusion to that being Sea since it's mine.

The custom disc recipes are meant to be a hidden easter egg, but if you just wanna know 'em, you'll find each record's valid items under `bcrmc6-data/data/bcrmc6/tags/item/valid_for_record_<name>.json`
